My grandfather was an Electrical Engineer, my dad was an Electrical Engineer, then I majored and worked in the Electrical Engineering field for 3 years. But while working with Software Engineers I learned I had a passion for programming and decided to commit to a career change into Software Engineering (Sorry Dad ðŸ˜…). I just finished my Master of Science in Computer Science from California State University Fullerton and Iâ€™m eager to apply what I've learned!",
